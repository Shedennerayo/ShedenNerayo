Hi 👋 My name is Sheden Nerayo
==============================

Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

Hello, my name is Sheden Nerayo and I'm currently based in Manchester. I hold a BA(Hons) Marketing/Media degree from The University of East London with a 2.1 grade, showcasing my dedication to learning and excellence. My passion for data analytics is what drives me towards this career path, as I'm fascinated by the power of data to drive insights and inform decision-making and shaping our future. That's why I've decided to embark on this Data bootcamp program at Just IT to enhance my skills and knowledge in this field. Throughout my journey, I've acquired valuable technical skills, including proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL, and data visualisation tools like Tableau and Power BI. Over the past decade, I've excelled in leadership roles across hospitality, logistics, and sales sectors.I've honed transferable skills such as attention to detail, meeting deadlines, organisation, and critical thinking.These qualities, combined with my technical expertise and passion for data, make me a valuable asset in the world of analytics.Therefore, my aim is to secure an apprenticeship or a junior role as a Data Analyst, Engineer, or Scientist. I thrive in dynamic environments and am eager to contribute innovative solutions to data challenges. One interesting aspect about me is that I managed to journey from a poverty-stricken environment, crossing the Sahara Desert at just thirteen, and growing up in a foster home. These experiences have instilled in me a profound sense of resilience and adaptability. I've learned to navigate life's challenges with unwavering determination and grit, cultivating a deep appreciation for every opportunity that comes my way. Now, I'm poised to leverage these experiences to build a rewarding career, utilising the lessons learned and showcasing my resilience in overcoming obstacles. With a steadfast commitment to personal growth, I am ready to make a meaningful impact and thrive in any endeavour I pursue.
